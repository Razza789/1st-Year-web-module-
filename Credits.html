                Security Considerations
                <p>
                    Theres quite a few security considerations that the toy company could use to protect itself from harmful attacks. The protections you could use could range from: storing passwords as a hash, rather than plain text, 
                    input validation and sanitisation. Hashing passwords turns the password from plaintext to a short string of letter nad numbers using an encryption algorithm. The reason why this is important in web security is 
                    because it makes it a lot more challenging for hackers to gain access to peoples passwords. Facebook "stored between 200 million and 600 million" Facebook users passwords in plain text. This is obviously a bad thing for the company
                    as it gave a lot of engineers access to peoples personal passwords and all it could take is for a hacker to breach the database and leak peoples passwords to the world. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Input validation and sanitisation is another way that you could protect your website from harmful attacks. Input validation is making sure that the input data falls within the expected domain of valid program inputs. 
                    Sanitisation is when the data is passed directly to a component in a trusted domain. "Data sanitisation is the process of ensuring that data conforms to the requirements of the subsystem to which it is passed." 
                    These can help stop injection attacks which is where "data is recieved by a component from an source outside the compenents trust boundary," this will give the user of the injection attack access to private information 
                    which is not intended to be displayed to the public. The information that could be compromised could be sensitive company data, users and private account information.
